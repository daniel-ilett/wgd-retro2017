# WGD ~ Retro (2017)
A game made for the "WGD Retro (2017)" theme. This jam ran from 19/10/17 to 9/11/17. Part of it was made during the 48hr jam which ran from 3/11/17 to 5/10/17 with the theme "One Remains", although it does not adhere to this theme.

This game is a remake of the game "I Will Be Happy", which was made for Ludum Dare 32 (An Unconventional Weapon).
